    <h3>You can always count on me when...</h3>
        <p>When you need someone to listen to you.</br>
        To go enjoying a sunny day. </br>
        When you need someone to go have an icecream with.</p>

   <h3>A funny story</h3>
            <p>Everytime I start a new job I have an epic fail...<br/>
            <p>Once I stapled myself in the hand and fainted on the first day.</p>
            <p>Another time, while I was on my way by bike in a rainy day where there was water and mud everywway in the road.
                At that moment a truck passed me and its wheel went into a mud puddle, creating a wave of mud that went all over me.
                I arrived at work covered in mud, I was basically just brown.<br/>
            </p>
            

   <h4>TL;DR</h4>
            <p>As I had to take a shower in the dressing room of the factory, they had to hang a paper saying "Woman inside", because it was all men there</p>
